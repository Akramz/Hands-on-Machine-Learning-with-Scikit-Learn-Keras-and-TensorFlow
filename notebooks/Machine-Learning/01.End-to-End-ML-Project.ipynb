    "\n",
    "- You first task is to use the california census data to build a model of the housing prices in the state.\n",
    "- This data includes metrics such as:\n",
    "    - Population\n",
    "    - Median Income\n",
    "    - Median housing price for each block group in California\n",
    "        - A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which cencus data is published\n",

    "        - We will call them \"districts\" for short.\n",

    "### Frame the problem\n",
    "- The first question to ask your boss is: \"What is the business objective?\"\n",
    "    - Building a model is probably not the end goal.\n",
    "- How does the comapny expects to benefit from the model?\n",
    "- Your boss answers that your model's output (A prediction for a district's median housing price) will be fed along other signals to another model to decide whether or not to invest in the district.\n",
    "- Getting this right is critical, as it's directly connects to revenue.\n",
    "- A sequence of data processing components is called a **data pipeline**\n",

    "- Components typically run asynchonosly\n",
    "- Each component pulls in a large amount of data, process it and splits out a result (prediction) into a data store.\n",
    "- Each component is fairly self-contained, the interface between components are the data stores.\n",
    "- Different teams can focus on different components.\n",
    "- The next question to ask your boss is \"what the current solution looks like?\"\n",
    "- Answer the following questions $\\to$\n",
    "    - Is the problem supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning?\n",
    "        - A supervised learning problem.\n",
    "    - Is it a classification or regression task?\n",
    "        - Since we're predicting the median housing price for a district, and since housing prices and numerical, this is a **Regression Task**\n",
    "    - Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques?\n",
    "        - Since cencus data is historical and does come every year, a **batch learning** approach is better.\n",

    "    - Computing the root of the sum of squares ($RMSE$) corresponds to the euclidian norm.\n",
    "        - It is also called $l_{2}$ norm.\n",
    "    - Computing the sum of absolutes ($MAE$) corresponds to the $l_{1}$ norm.\n",
    "    - More generally, the norm $l_{k}$ of a vector $\\bf{x}$ is:\n",
    "$$||v||_{k} = (\\sum_{i=1}^{m} |v_{i}|^{k})^{1 \\over k}$$\n",
    "        - $l_{0}$ gives the number of non-zero elements in the vector $v$\n",

    "    - This is why $RMSE$ is more sensitive to large errors than $MAE$.\n",

    "- There are a few things you might notice in these histograms:\n",
    "    - The `median_income` attribute isn't expressed in US dollars.\n",
    "        - After checking with the team — the numbers roughly represent tens of thousands of dollars.\n",
    "    - The `housing_median_age` and the `median_house_value` were also capped.\n",
    "        - This might pose a problem especially for the second attribute since it represent the output we want to predict.\n",
    "        - Your machine learning algorithms may learn that prices never go beyond that limit.\n",
    "        - You need to check with your client's team if this can be a problem or not.\n",
    "        - If they tell you that they need precise predictions even beyond 500,000USD, then you have 2 options:\n",
    "            - Manually collect the actual labels of districts with a `median_house_value`>=500,000USD.\n",
    "            - Remove those districts from the training/test sets, we don't want the model to learn never to go beyond 500,000USD.\n",
    "    - The attributes have very different scales, we will discuss feature scaling later.\n",
    "    - The attributes are **tail-heavy** & they often extend to the right than to the left\n",
    "        - As a result, It will be difficult for many machine learning algorithms to find patterns within the data.\n",
    "        - We will learn how to transform the distribution from a tailed one to a bell-shaped normal/gaussian one."
