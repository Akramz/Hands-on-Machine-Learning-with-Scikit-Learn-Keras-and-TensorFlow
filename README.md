# Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TF by Aurelien Geron

<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:100%" src="static/imgs/book_cover.png"></div>

This repo is home to notes & code that accompanies Part 1 of Aurelien Geron's "Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TF" book. The book provides a comprehensive overview of data science, machine learning (with `scikit-learn`), and deep learning (with `tensorflow`).

The Book assumes you know close to nothing about machine learning. It uses production-ready Python frameworks such as:
- `Scikit-Learn`
- `Keras`
- `TensorFlow`

The author favors a hands-on approach through a series of working examples and just a little bit of theory. Prerequesites:
- Some Python programming experience
- Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- A reasonable understanding of college-level math (calculus, probability, Linear Algebra, and statistics)

The first part of the book is mostly based on `Scikit-Learn`, while the 2nd part is using `Keras/TensorFlow`.
