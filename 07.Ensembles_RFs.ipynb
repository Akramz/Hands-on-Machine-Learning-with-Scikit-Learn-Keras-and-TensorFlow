    "# Chapter 7. Ensemble Learning & Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we ask a random question to thousands of people, then aggregate their answers. In many cases we will find that this aggregated answer is better than an **expert's answer** (*really*). This is called the *wisdom of the crowd*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we aggregate the predictions of a group of models (such as classifiers or regressors), we will often get better predictions than the best individual predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of predictors is called an ensemble. Thus this technique is called **ensemble learning**, and an ensemble learning algorithm is called an **Ensemble Method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of an ensemble method, we can train a group of decision tree classifiers, each on a *random subset* of the training data. Such an ensemble of decision trees is called a **random forest**. Despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often use ensemble methods near the end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine them into an even better predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss the most famous ensemble learning methods, including: **Bagging, Boosting, & Stacking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voting Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have trained a few classifiers, each achieving an 80% accuracy. A very simple way to create an even better classifiers is to aggregate the predictions of all our classifiers and choose the prediction that is the most frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Majority voting classification is called **Hard Voting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" src=\"static/imgs/Hard_voting.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, this classifier achieves an even better accuracy than the best predictor in the ensemble. Even if each classifier is a weak learner (does slightly better then random guessing). Assuming that we have a sufficient number of weak learners and enough diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the law of large numbers, if we build an ensemble containing 1,000 classifiers with individual accuracies of $51%$ & trained for binary classification, If we predict the majority voting class, we can hope for up to $75%$ accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only true if all classifiers are completely independent, making uncorrelated errors, which is clearly not the case because they are trained on the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get diverse classifiers is use different algorithms for each one of them & train them on different subset of the training data. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting refers to any ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner. The general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular one is **AdaBoost** (Adaptive boosting) and **gradient boosting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with Adaboost:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "One way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training instances that were underfitted. This results in the later predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases (the technique used by Adaboost).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure demenstrates the process\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"static/imgs/adaboost.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm first trains a base classifier and use it to make predictions on the training set. It then increases the weight of the missclassified instances and pass its weights + the data to the next predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative learning approach shares similarities with gradient descent, except in gradient descent we're using the gradients to minimize a cost function, but with `AdaBoost` we're simply adding more learners to the chain. There is one important drawback of this method, It cannot be parallalized because each predictor needs the output of the previous predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the Adaboost Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each instance weight $w^{(i)}$ is initially set to $1/m$.\n",
    "2. A first predictor is trained, and its weighted error rate $r_1$ is computed on the training set using the general formula, where $\\hat{y}_j^{(i)}$ is the $j^{th}$ predictor's prediction for the $i^{th}$ instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_j=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1(\\hat{y_j^{(i)}}\\neq{y^{(i)}})}^{m} w^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}w^{(i)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the predictor's weight $\\alpha_{0}$ is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_{j}=\\eta log(\\frac{1-r_j}{r_j})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The more accurate the predictor is, the higher its weight will be. If it's just guessing randomly, then its weight will be close to zero. However, If it's most often wrong, then its weight will be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The algorithm updates the instance weights which boosts the weights of the misclassified instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\forall i \\in \\{1,2, \\dots, m\\} \\\\ w^{(i)} \\leftarrow \\begin{cases}\n",
    "w^{(i)},  & \\text{if $\\hat{y}^{(i)}_j = y^{(i)}$} \\\\\n",
    "w^{(i)}exp(\\alpha_{j}), & \\text{else}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all the instance weights are normalized (are divided by the sum of the weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, a new predictor is trained using the updated weights, and the whole process is repeated again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm stops when the desired number of predictors is reached, or when a perfect predictor is found. To make predictions, Adaboost simply computes the predictions of all the predictors and weight them using the predictor weights $\\alpha_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted class is the one that receives the majority of the weighted votes (where $N$ is the number of predictors):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}(x)=argmax_{k}\\sum_{j=1 \\; \\hat{y}_j(x)=k}^{N}\\alpha_j$$\n",
    "\n",
