    "- Suppose you pose a random question to thousands of people, then aggregate their answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than an **expert's answer** (*really*).\n",

    "- Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get better predictions than the best individual predictor.\n",
    "- A group of predictors is called an ensemble. Thus this technique is called **ensemble learning**, and an ensemble learning algorithm is called an **Ensemble Method**.\n",
    "- As an example of an ensemble method, you can train a group of decision tree classifiers, each on a *random subset* of the training data. \n",
    "    - Such an ensemble of decision trees is called a **random forest**. \n",
    "    - Despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms available today.\n",
    "- You will often use ensemble methods near the end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine them into an even better predictor.\n",

    "- Somewhat surprisingly, this classifier achieves an even better accuracy than the best predictor in the ensemble.\n",
    "    - Even if each classifier is a weak learner (does slightly better then random guessing).\n",
    "        - Provided there are a sufficient number of weak learners and enough diversity.\n",
    "- Due to the law of large numbers, if you build an ensemble containing 1,000 classifiers with individual accuracies of $51%$ & trained for binary classification, If you predict the majority voting class, you can hope for up to $75%$ accuracy.\n",
    "    - This is only true if all classifiers are completely independent, making uncorrelated errors, which is clearly not the case because they are trained on the same data.\n",
    "- One way to get diverse classifiers is use different algorithms for each one of them & train them on different subset of the training data. \n",

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting refers to any ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner.\n",
    "- The general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor. \n",
    "- There are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular one is **AdaBoost** (Adaptive boosting) and **gradient boosting**.\n",
    "- Let's start with Adaboost:"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "- One way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training instances that were underfitted.\n",
    "- this results in the later predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases.\n",
    "- & This is the technique used by Adaboost.\n",
    "- The following figure demenstrates the process\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img style=\"width:50%;\" src=\"static/imgs/adaboost.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm first trains a base classifier and use it to make predictions on the training set. the algorithm then increases the weight of the missclassified instances and pass its weights + the data to the next predictor.\n",
    "- This iterative learning approach shares similarities with gradient descent, except in gradient descent we're using the gradients to minimize a cost function, but with AdaBoost we're simply adding more learners to the chain.\n",
    "- There is one important drawback of this method, It cannot be parallalized because each predictor needs the output of the previous predictor.\n",
    "- Let's take a closer look at the Adaboost Algorithm:\n",
    "- Each instance weight $w^{(i)}$ is initially set to $1/m$.\n",
    "- A first predictor is trained, and its weighted error rate $r_1$ is computed on the training set using the general formula, where:\n",
    "    - $\\hat{y}_j^{(i)}$ is the $j^{th}$ predictor's prediction for the $i^{th}$ instance.\n",
    "$$r_j=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1(\\hat{y_j^{(i)}}\\neq{y^{(i)}})}^{m} w^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}w^{(i)}}$$\n",
    "- the predictor's weight $\\alpha_{0}$ is computed as follows:\n",
    "$$\\alpha_{j}=\\eta log(\\frac{1-r_j}{r_j})$$\n",
    "- The more accurate the predictor is, the higher its weight will be. If it's just guessing randomly, then its weight will be close to zero.\n",
    "    - However, If it's most often wrong, then its weight will be negative.\n",
    "- Next the adaboost algorithm updates the instance weights which boosts the weights of the misclassified instances:\n",
    "$$\\forall i \\in \\{1,2, \\dots, m\\} \\\\ w^{(i)} \\leftarrow \\begin{cases}\n",
    "w^{(i)},  & \\text{if $\\hat{y}^{(i)}_j = y^{(i)}$} \\\\\n",
    "w^{(i)}exp(\\alpha_{j}), & \\text{else}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "- Then all the instance weights are normalized (are divided by the sum of the weights).\n",
    "- Finally, a new predictor is trained using the updated weights, and the whole process is repeated again.\n",
    "- The algorithm stops when the desired number of predictors is reached, or when a perfect predictor is found.\n",
    "- To make predictions, Adaboost simply computes the predictions of all the predictors and weight them using the predictor weights $\\alpha_j$.\n",
    "- The predicted class is the one that receives the majority of the weighted votes (where $N$ is the number of predictors):\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}(x)=argmax_{k}\\sum_{j=1 \\; \\hat{y}_j(x)=k}^{N}\\alpha_j$$\n",
    "- Let's use scikit-learn's implementation of Adaboost with 1 depth decision trees:"

    "## Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "- The last ensemble method we will discuss in this chapter is called stacking (short for stacked generalization).\n",
    "- It is based on a simple idea\n",
    "    - Instead of using trivial functions (such as hard voting) to aggregate the predictions of all predictors in an ensemble, Why don't we train a model to do that for us?\n",
    "    - The final aggregator learner is typically called a **blender** or a **meta-learner**.\n",
    "- Following figure outlines the idea of learning aggregations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img style=\"width: 50%;\" src=\"static/imgs/blender.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- To train a blender, a common approach is to use a holdout set.\n",
    "- We first train predictors on the first holdout set.\n",
    "- Then the first layer predictors are used to export predictions of the second held-out set.\n",
    "    - This ensures that the predictions are clean since the predictors never saw the 2nd held-out instances during training.\n",
    "- The result is that for each instance in the holdout set, we have 3 predictions, the 3 predictions per row will be considered as input for the blender.\n",
    "    - The blender is trained on this new dataset.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, `scikit-learn` doesn't support stacking directly."
